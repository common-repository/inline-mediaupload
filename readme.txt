== Description ==

The WordPress Media Upload Feature has grown up and is much more intuitive and usable since WP 3.3 and should be integrated more tightly into the WordPress post/page forms.

Inline Mediaupload introduces a new meta-box on post/page forms which directly contains the media-upload.php iframe otherwise only reachable via button/lightbox.

The iframe automatically resizes smoothly with its inner content thus hiding the iframe-nature of the content.

Additionally, the plugin introduces a new meta-box area to the forms allowing you to move any meta-box just below the title input field - that's just my personal favorite location for placing the new upload-box ;-)

Enjoy!
